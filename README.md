# Flamingo test task
## Description
**ü¶©Flamingo Home Assignment Full-Stack Engineer**

We‚Äôd like to get a sense of how you structure full-stack applications, work with modern frameworks, and handle typical frontend/backend tasks. This assignment is not tied to Flamingo‚Äôs domain; feel free to choose any topic or idea that‚Äôs simple but meaningful to you.

**üõ†Ô∏è What to do:**

Build a small full-stack web application

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS for styling
Backend: Node.js or any other language
The app should include basic CRUD functionality connected to a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)

Implement SSO authentication

Integrate a simple Single Sign-On (SSO) flow (e.g., Google, GitHub, or similar via OAuth2)
Use a service like Auth0, Firebase Auth, or direct OAuth integration ‚Äî up to you

Include database interaction

Store and retrieve data from a database
You can use an ORM (e.g., Prisma, TypeORM, Sequelize) or raw queries

Note: For database needs, you can use services like Supabase, and for deployment, platforms like Vercel,  both of which offer free tiers for small-scale projects and provide fast, reliable performance.

**‚úÖ Expected Deliverables:**

A link to a public GitHub repository with:

Full source code (frontend + backend)

Set up instructions in a README.md (how to run locally, env setup, etc.)

Brief notes on your architecture and decisions (can be in README or a separate file)

A working deployment URL (the project should be deployed and accessible, not just left with instructions to run it.

This task is not meant to take too many hours. We value your time and want to get a clear picture of how you approach full-stack development in a clean, thoughtful, and structured way.

Looking forward to seeing your work! Good luck! ü¶© üí´
